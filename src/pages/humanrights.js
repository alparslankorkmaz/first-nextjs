              2. Anti-slavery and human trafficking policy Policy statement
            </p>
            <p className="my-0">
              2.1 Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human
              rights. It takes various forms, such as slavery, servitude, forced
              and compulsory labour and human trafficking, all of which have in
              common the deprivation of a person's liberty by another in order
              to exploit them for personal or commercial gain. We have a
              zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery, all forms of forced
              labour and any form of human trafficking and we are committed to
              acting ethically and with integrity in all our business dealings
              and relationships to ensure modern slavery is not taking place
              anywhere in our own business or in any of our supply chains.
            </p>
            <p className="my-0">
              2.2 We are also committed to ensuring there is transparency in our
              own business, consistent with our disclosure obligations under the
              Modern Slavery Act 2015. We expect the same high standards from
              all of our contractors, suppliers and other business partners.
            </p>
            <p className="my-0">
              2.3 We prohibit the hiring of individuals under 18 years of age
              for positions in which hazardous work is required.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-0">
              2.4 This policy applies to all persons working for us or on our
              behalf in any capacity, including employees at all levels,
              contractors, external consultants, third-party representatives and
              business partners.
            </p>

            <p className="mt-5 mb-0">3. Responsibility for the policy</p>
            <p className="mt-0">
              3.1 The Managing Director holds overall responsibility for
              ensuring this policy complies with our legal and ethical
              obligations, and that all those in our supply chain comply with
              it.
            </p>

            <p className="mt-5 mb-0">4. Compliance with the policy</p>
            <p className="my-0">
              4.1 Employees must ensure that they read, understand and comply
              with this policy.
            </p>
            <p className="my-0">
              4.2 The prevention, detection and reporting of modern slavery in
              any part of our business or supply chains is the responsibility of
              all those working for us or under our control. Employees are
              required to avoid any activity that might lead to, or suggest, a
              breach of this policy.
            </p>
            <p className="my-0">
              4.3 Employees must notify their manager as soon as possible if
              they believe or suspect that a conflict with this policy has
              occurred, or may occur in the future at the earliest possible
              stage.
            </p>
            <p className="my-0">
              4.4 If an employee is unsure about whether a particular act, the
              treatment of workers more generally, or their working conditions
              within any tier of our supply chains constitutes any of the
              various forms of modern slavery, it should be raised with their
              manager.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-0">
              4.5 We aim to encourage openness and will support anyone who
              raises genuine concerns in good faith under this policy, even if
              they turn out to be mistaken. We are committed to ensuring no one
              suffers any detrimental treatment as a result of reporting in good
              faith their suspicion that modern slavery of whatever form is or
              may be taking place in any part of our own business or in any of
              our supply chains. Detrimental treatment includes dismissal,
              disciplinary action, threats or other unfavourable treatment
              connected with raising a concern. If you believe that you have
              suffered any such treatment, you should inform Human Resources. If
              the matter is not remedied, and you are an employee, you should
              raise it formally using our Grievance Procedure.

              forced labour and any form of human trafficking must be
              communicated to all suppliers, contractors and business partners
              at the outset of our business relationship with them and
